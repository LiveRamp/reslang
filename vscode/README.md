# reslang-syntax-highlighting 

This extension supports syntax highlighting for Reslang.

It is a work in progress; this initial iteration is pretty basic, so as to get something mostly useful out the door. 

## Usage

In VSCode, "Install Extensions", then beside the search bar, click "...", select "Install from VSIX", and point it to [reslang-syntax-highlighting-0.0.1.vsix](reslang-syntax-highlighting-0.0.1.vsix)

## Rebuilding the package

The built package is the `.vsix` file. If you would like to rebuild it, run 
```
yarn vsce package
```

Be sure to bump the version if you intend on publishing it to GitHub.
