# reslang-syntax-highlighting 

This extension supports syntax highlighting for Reslang.

It is a work in progress; this initial iteration is pretty basic, so as to get something mostly useful out the door. 

## Usage

In VSCode, "Install Extensions", then beside the search bar, click "...", select "Install from VSIX", and point it to [reslang-syntax-highlighting-0.0.1.vsix](reslang-syntax-highlighting-0.0.1.vsix)
